    <p>Lethal Company is a cooperative video game developed by Zeekerss. It released in early access for Microsoft Windows in October 2023. Lethal Company gained popularity over the month of November 2023 on storefront Steam.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>

    <p>Lethal Company is a cooperative video game for up to four players played in first-person perspective. Set in a retrofuturistic setting, players work as contracted employees of "The Company". They are able to communicate with each other through the in-game proximity chat, as well as proximity text chat. Players are tasked with visiting abandoned moons in order to collect as much scrap as possible. Each moon has one facility containing procedurally-generated rooms, alongside scrap, hazardous traps, and malicious creatures. Players must work quickly and return to their ship before midnight, or it will leave without them. Collected scrap is sold at the Company moon to obtain Company credits.[2][3] At the end of each deadline, if the players sell enough scrap to reach the required quota, they will begin another three-day cycle with a higher profit goal. Failure to meet the Company's quota results in players being ejected into space.[4]</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>
